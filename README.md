# GreeceJS: Speaker Guidelines

### TL;DR

Speak Greek or English - Talk about something you genuinely care about - Be cool, you’re going to be a YouTube star - Make it readable - Stay on schedule - Don’t offend people.

### Long Story

Talks can be either in **Greek or English**. Don’t feel pressured to deliver your talk in english if you’re more comfortable speaking in Greek - or vice-versa! 

You think we’re not interested in your _topic_? Think again! Well yes, our name totally relates us to Javascript - you got that part right! But we actually care about lots of stuff. Yes, usually computer science related but that nowadays covers a lot. Your talk doesn’t have to be technical or about a trending topic. It doesn’t have to be very advanced either. We do love original content though! Don’t spend tons of hours and dozens of slides to deliver a tutorial someone could have easily found on Google. Add your touch to it. Oh and keep in mind that attendees prefer content to sales promotions.

Please don’t be disappointed if your talk doesn’t get selected for the next event. The agenda may be full already, so you’ll be joining the next one. Or your talk may need something to spice it up in which case we’ll provide you with the necessary feedback.

We’re **recording**, subtitling and uploading all talks on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCHuFcm2K1dBAZzEBmHjPxQ) for everyone in the community to enjoy. Be cool - we’ll never edit or twist your words or content in any way.

We’re currently hosted at [Innovathens](https://www.innovathens.gr/) where we’re lucky to have 3 large TVs to present on. This means that your presentation will take the most out of our displays if it’s on a **16:9 aspect ratio**.

Don’t be the - _“I know you can't see this, but...”_ - speaker. We’ re not THAT dogmatic to suggest the 30px minimum font from the [10/20/30 rule](https://guykawasaki.com/the_102030_rule/) (a very interesting read btw) but any code snippets or live coding you present, should be quite easy to read. We suggest a **18px minimum font size** and a **maximum of 10 lines for code snippets** embedded into your presentation. Otherwise switch to your favourite editor where you can scroll and zoom in. 

Ok, we’re not punctual as hell, but please try hard not to exceed your time limit :). We typically allocate **30 mins for the talk and 15 mins for the Q&A**, but if you have this awesome - can’t make shorter talk - please let us know in advance so that we adjust the schedule.

We organise this group out of love for the community. And we think that this community is inclusive. So it goes without saying that we want to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), or… technology choices. Please keep that in mind.

Thanks!

The GreeceJS team :-)
